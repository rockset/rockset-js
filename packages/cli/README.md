# Download & Installation Instructions

### Install Using `curl` (Recommended)

This standalone installation is ideal for most environments as it contains its own Node.js binary and automatically updates. However, it is **not Windows compatible**.

```
curl https://rockset-cli-artifacts.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/install-standalone.sh | bash
```

Running this script requires sudo access. **Be sure to restart your command line once the installation is completed.**

### Install Using `npm` (Not Recommended)

As a standalone Node.js binary, you can also install the `@rockset/cli` package directly from `npm`. However, it is strongly recommended that you use another installation method as the package will not be able to autoupdate and requires you to use your system's version of Node.js. If you choose to use this installation method, ensure you are on Node.js 10.x or 12.x before attempting it.

```
npm install -g @rockset/cli
```

### Update to Latest Version

You can update the Rockset CLI to the latest version at any time using `rockset update`.

```
$ rockset update
```

After an update, run `rockset autocomplete -r` to rebuild the autocomplete cache.

### Verify Your Installation

To verify that your installation was completed successfully, run `rockset --version` in your command line.

```
$ rockset --version
```

### Install Autocomplete

The Rockset CLI Autocomplete feature allows you to preview and complete commands using the tab key. It is currently compatible with bash and zsh.

To install this feature, run `rockset autocomplete` in your command line.

```
$ rockset autocomplete
```

**Note: If you are installing autocomplete on macOS and using it from a login shell, you may need to run the following command:**

```bash
$ echo 'source ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

You may need to restart your command line after all steps to enable the autocomplete feature after installation.

# Authentication and Profile Management (`rockset auth`)

To use the Rockset CLI tool, you will need to create an authentication profile using your API Key which can be created and found in the [Rockset Console](https://console.rockset.com/apikeys).

Once you have successfully obtained your API key, run the `rockset auth add` command to create your authentication profile. Running the following command will create an authentication profile named `default`:

```
$ rockset auth add default [API Key]
```

You can add multiple profiles as needed. To view all profiles and switch between them, use the following commands:

```bash
#. View auth profiles
$ rockset auth list

#. Use a different auth profile
$ rockset auth use
```

You can find a complete reference for all supported `rockset auth` commands [here](/packages/cli/reference/auth.md).

### Multi-region support

By default, the Rockset CLI tool uses the Oregon 1 server. To select another region, you will need to add and use a new profile that explicitly sets a different region. For more information, check out `rockset auth` commands [here](/packages/cli/reference/auth.md).

# Access the Rockset API from the Command Line (`rockset api`)

The `rockset api` commands allow you to access any of the [Rockset API endpoints](https://docs.rockset.com/rest-api).

You can find a complete reference for all supported `rockset api` commands [here](/packages/cli/reference/api.md), along with detailed examples for
most commands. Each API command accepts positional arguments that translate to the URL parameters of the REST endpoint that they wrap. Commands that wrap POST endpoints must additionally take a JSON or YAML file which specifies the data to be passed.

## Sample Code Snippets

Every endpoint in the [Rockset API](https://docs.rockset.com/rest-api) can be accessed using the `rockset api` commands, where **GET** parameters are directly defined as command line arguments and **POST** endpoints are defined using JSON or YAML files.

Below are several examples to help you get started:

### Collections

**List All Collections**

```bash
$ rockset api collections listCollections
```

**Create a Collection (Empty)**

```yaml
# YAML file for POST body
name: testCollection
description: a test collection
```

```bash
$ rockset api collections createCollection commons --body body.yaml
...
```

**Create a Collection (Using a Data Source)**

```yaml
# YAML file for POST body
name: testCollection
sources:
  - s3:
      access_key: ''
      secret_access: ''
      prefix: partial-cities
      region: us-west-2
      bucket: rockset-public-datasets
      prefixes:
        - partial-cities
      mappings: []
    format: JSON

# optionally specify retention duration of all documents in this collection
retention_secs: 100000
```

```bash
$ rockset api collections createCollection commons --body body.yaml
...
```

**Create a Collection (With Field Mappings)**

```yaml
# YAML file for POST body
name: testCollection
sources:
  - s3:
      access_key: ''
      secret_access: ''
      prefix: partial-cities
      region: us-west-2
      bucket: rockset-public-datasets
      prefixes:
        - partial-cities
      mappings: []
    format: JSON
field_mappings:
  - name: country_length_mapper
    # used for Field Whitelisting
    is_drop_all_fields:
    input_fields:
      - field_name: fields.country

        # either 'SKIP' or 'PASS'
        if_missing: PASS

        # drop this field
        is_drop: true

        # optional parameter name to be referenced in output_field sql
        param: country

    output_field:
      field_name: lenCountry

      # SQL transformation used to create a new field
      value:
        sql: LENGTH(:country)

      # either 'SKIP' or 'FAIL'
      on_error: SKIP
```

```bash
$ rockset api collections createCollection commons --body body.yaml
...
```

### Documents

**Add Documents**

```yaml
# YAML file for POST body
data:
  - col1: val1
  - col1: val2
```

```bash
$ rockset api documents addDocuments commons testCollection --body body.yaml
...
```

**Delete Documents**

```yaml
# YAML file for POST body
data:
  - _id: 2774620d-7bd8-4b7a-bb2e-f8f477a8bdf4-1
  - _id: 2774620d-7bd8-4b7a-bb2e-f8f477a8bdf4-2
```

```bash
$ rockset api documents deleteDocuments commons testCollection --body body.yaml
...
```

### Aliases

**Create Alias**

```yaml
# YAML file for POST body
name: testAlias
description: alias for testCollection
collections:
  - commons.testCollection
```

```bash
$ rockset api aliases createAlias commons --body body.yaml
...
```

**Update Alias**

```yaml
# YAML file for POST body
description: alias for testCollection2
collections:
  - commons.testCollection2
```

```bash
$ rockset api aliases updateAlias commons testAlias --body body.yaml
...
```

### Workspaces

**Create Workspace**

```yaml
# YAML file for POST body
name: testWorkspace
description: a test workspace
```

```bash
$ rockset api workspaces createWorkspace --body body.yaml
...
```

## Output Format Options

All API Commands by default will intelligently grab the most relevant part of the response data and display it for you in a table. The most commonly used flags are shown below. The full set of flags can be found by setting the `-h` flag.

```
  --columns=columns              only show provided columns (comma-separated)

  --output=csv|json|yaml         output in a more machine friendly format
```

# Execute SQL from the Command Line (`rockset sql`)

The `rockset sql` commands allow you to execute any SQL statement.

You can pass a SQL string directly as an argument:

```
$ rockset sql "SELECT 'hello, world!'"
```

You can also not pass any arguments, in which case you will be prompted to open your default text editor. Saving and closing the file
will execute the SQL statement contained within it.

```bash
$ rockset sql
? sql: Press <enter> to launch your preferred editor.
```

You can find a complete reference for the `rockset sql` command [here](/packages/cli/reference/sql.md).

# Create and Deploy Query Lambdas (`rockset local`)

The `rockset local` commands allow you to create Query Lambdas locally, include them in your source code and deploy them to Rockset.

You can find a complete reference for all supported `rockset local` commands [here](/packages/cli/reference/local.md).

You can find a 'Hello world' tutorial [here](/packages/cli/tutorials/queryLambdaHelloWorld.md).

### Set Up Query Lambdas Source Directory

Before you can proceed with any of the following steps, run `rockset local:init` to configure the source directory for your Query Lambdas.
You'll be prompted for a relative path (`./src` by default) that will serve as the home for your Query Lambda definition and SQL files.

### Download Existing Query Lambdas from Rockset

If you've already created Query Lambdas through the Rockset Console, you can download them to your local filesystem using the `rockset local:download`
command. You can specify particular Query Lambda tags to download as arguments (see `rockset local:download -h` for full details).

Each Query Lambda downloaded will write both a definition file and a SQL file. A sample file structure might look like:

```bash
#. After downloading three Query Lambdas: commons.getMovies, commons.getMovieRatings and quickstart.helloWorld
$ tree
.
├── rockset.config.json
└── src
    ├── commons
    │   ├── getMovies.lambda.json
    │   ├── getMovieRatings.lambda.json
    │   └── __sql
    │       ├── getMovies.sql
    │       └── getMovieRatings.sql
    └── quickstart
        ├── helloWorld.lambda.json
        └── __sql
            └── helloWorld.sql
```

### Add a New Query Lambda

You can set up a new Query Lambda locally by running:

```
rockset local queryLambda add [workspaceName].[queryLambdaName]
rockset local queryLambda add commons.helloWorld
```

This command will construct two boilerplate files on your behalf:

- `[workspaceName]/[queryLambdaName].lambda.json` - definition file that includes meta information such as description and default parameters.
- `[workspaceName]/__sql/[queryLambdaName].sql` - SQL file that contains the SQL statement associated with this Query Lambda.

### Write and Edit Query Lambda SQL

Write the SQL for your Query Lambda in the `.sql` file created in the section above. You can use any editor,
but we encourage you to try VSCode and the [Rockset VSCode plugin](/packages/rscode), which offers syntax highlighting, autocomplete and more.

### Execute and Test Query Lambda SQL

You can test your Query Lambda SQL during development in several different ways.

For simple, unparametrized queries with simple results, you can trigger an execution through VSCode itself
(`Execute Rockset Query` from the VSCode Command Pallate).

You can also execute Query Lambda SQL direclty from the command line:

```
$ rockset local queryLambda execute commons.helloWorld
```

For more complex queries or queries with parameters, you can use the [Rockset Developer UI](/packages/dev-server). You can
start the Developer UI with the following command:

```
$ rockset local serve
```

This command spins up a local webserver that displays all of the Query Lambdas found in your local project, allows
you to easily specify and manage query parameters, and offers fully featured data tables and JSON renderers to view your
SQL results.

### Deploy Query Lambdas to Rockset

Up to this point, none of the commands we've run have actually created or updated any resources in our Rockset account.
To take the Query Lambdas defined locally and deploy them to Rockset, we can run the following command:

```
$ rockset local deploy -l commons.helloWorld -t dev
```

If a Query Lambda named `commons.helloWorld` already exists in Rockset (for example, if you'd already `deploy`'d it previously,
or you had created a Query Lambda with the same name in the Rockset Console), this command will create a new version hash and append
it to the version history for this Query Lambda. If such a Query Lambda does not yet exist, it will create a new Query Lambda.

Note: if you do not provide either the `-l` or `-w` flags, this command will attempt to update all of the Query Lambdas that are currently defined locally regardless of whether or not you actually made changes to them. This may cause you to hit rate limits. If you do encounter rate limits, you have two options:

1. Limit the number of Query Lambdas that are in your local state.
2. Call the deploy command with the `--onlyDeployIfFlagged` option. Calling this command with that flag enabled will cause the CLI to ignore any Query Lambdas that do not have config.flagForDeploy set to true in the local file. You must handle setting this value for each Query Lambda yourself.

You can tag this Query Lambda with the `-t` flag — this flag will apply the specified tag to the Query Lambda version created.

So long as your applications hitting this Query Lambda are executing it by tag (as opposed to version hash), you can use this command
to deploy an updated query (or rollback to a previous query) without having to deploy your application code at all.

### Integrate with Version Control and CI/CD

You can check all of your Query Lambda files into your version control system as you might with any other application files. You can also use the `deploy`
command to deploy your Query Lambdas automatically in CI/CD.

```bash
#. In CI/CD
rockset local deploy -t development
...

#. When you want to deploy to production
git checkout <commit hash>
rockset local deploy -t production
```

Then, your application can hit Query Lambda `helloWorld` with tag `development` in development, and hit `helloWorld` with tag `production` in the production environment.

```js
// JS Application Example
rockset.queryLambdas.executeQueryLambdaByTag(
  'commons',
  'helloWorld',
  isProduction() ? 'production' : 'development',
);
```

# Telemetry

The Rockset CLI includes a telemetry feature that collects some usage data. This feature is enabled by default. We never log any sensitive data, query text, or query result data.

To opt out of telemetry, set the ROCKSET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to 1 or true.
